## Description

This module will install and configure [Gogs (A painless self-hosted Git service.)](http://gogs.io)
by using the preferred way of [installing Gogs from binary](https://gogs.io/docs/installation/install_from_binary)
instead of using any Thirdparty PPA´s.
You are completely free to configure Gogs for your needs since this module allows dynamic configuration for the `custom/conf/app.in` file.

## Setup

### What gogs affects

Gogs will be installed in the given installation directory (`/opt/gogs` by default) and a
service will be installed with an init.d script (by default the service is called `gogs`).

Beside from that nothing else will be affected on your system.

### Setup Requirements

`MySQL` or `PostgreSQL` and `git` are not being installed by this module. Make sure those services are
installed before using this module. 
Have a look at the [prerequisites documentation of Gogs](https://gogs.io/docs/installation) for quick step into it.

### Beginning with gogs

You can simply include the `gogs` module to get started with the defaults. Check out the [reference](#reference) to see what the defaults are.

    include ::gogs
    

## Usage

The most common way of using the `gogs` module with a custom configuration is the following.
> **Note**: You are able to provide any available Gogs configuration in `app_ini` and `app_ini_sections`. For a 
complete list of available configuration have a look at the [Gogs configuration cheat sheet](https://gogs.io/docs/advanced/configuration_cheat_sheet).
  
    class { '::gogs':
        app_ini => {
            'APP_NAME' => 'My Fancy GIT Service'
        },
        app_ini_sections => {
            'server'   => {
                'DOMAIN'    => 'git.example.com',
                'HTTP_PORT' => 3000,
            },
            'database' => {
                'DB_TYPE' => 'mysql',
                'HOST'    => 'localhost:3306',
                'NAME'    => 'gogs',
                'USER'    => 'gogs',
                'PASSWD'  => 'mysecretpasswd',
            },
            'security' => {
                'SECRET_KEY' => 'mysecretkey',
            }
        },
    }

#### sysconfig

  and depends on your distribution. If you need to change variables for the daemon script use this parameter.
  The provided variables are stored in a sysconfig file depending on your distribution and service name (e.g `/etc/default/gogs`)
  and are then automatically interpreted by the daemon scripts.
  
    class { '::gogs':
        sysconfig => {
            'NAME' => { value => 'gogitsgogs' },
